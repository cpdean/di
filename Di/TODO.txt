Implement existing commands.

Use a block cursor in command mode. Accomplish this by two steps:

    1. Change the color of the normal cursor to match the background
    2. Change the foreground and background colors of the character after the cursor
       so it appears that the block cursor is there.

Make keybindings configurable

    In the model, map keybindings to command names as strings.

    Add an attribute to each command class that specifies its name as a string.

    At startup, use reflection on our assembly to find all implementors of
    ICommand which have the name attribute, and add them to a lookup table.

    Eventually, there will be a configuration option allowing other assemblies
    containing commands to be loaded dynamically and searched for commands.
