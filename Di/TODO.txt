Finish command parser.

Change the type of LoneCommand.Execute to also take a Controller.Main parameter.

Make the controller parse and execute the input.

Implement existing commands.

Use a block cursor in command mode. Accomplish this by two steps:

    1. Change the color of the normal cursor to match the background
    2. Change the foreground and background colors of the character after the cursor
       so it appears that the block cursor is there.
