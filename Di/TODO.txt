Add an insert mode binding that implements Backspace.

	Add a Delete RangeCommand and a Backspace MoveCommand.
	
	That MoveCommand goes back one character, unless backing up into leading
	whitespace, in which case it goes by tabs.
	
	Bind the Backspace key to Backspace applied to Delete.

Implement remaining basic commands:
    Up line
    Left char
    Right char

Wrap the text inputs in horizontal and vertical scrollpanes.

Replace the term "visible buffer" with something shorter and more distinct, perhaps "viewport".

Add support for files projects

    Search up from the current directory for di-project.ini
        Globs for inclusion and exclusion of files into project
        Project name (show it, and nothing else other than "Di", in the title bar)

    Add commands:
        Add a new visible buffer and switch to it
        Hide the current visible buffer
        Load a file in the current visible buffer

    Keep a list of project files sorted by most-recently-visible
        Prefer the most-recently-visible file over other matches
        Already-visible files should be least-preferred
            But allow a file to become visible in multiple places

Store session state alongside the controlling di-project.ini file

Add support for the pasting stack
    Visual support
    Delete-and-push command
    Push command
    Pop-and-paste command
    Pop-and-discard command

Use a block cursor in command mode. Accomplish this by two steps:

    1. Change the color of the normal cursor to match the background
    2. Change the foreground and background colors of the character after the cursor
       so it appears that the block cursor is there.

Make keybindings configurable

    In the model, map keybindings to command names as strings.

    Add an attribute to each command class that specifies its name as a string.

    At startup, use reflection on our assembly to find all implementors of
    ICommand which have the name attribute, and add them to a lookup table.

    Eventually, there will be a configuration option allowing other assemblies
    containing commands to be loaded dynamically and searched for commands.
