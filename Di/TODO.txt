Create a proper command parser

    This class will have four static equivalence classes of command atoms:

    1. Lone atoms
    2. Movement atoms
    3. Action atoms
    4. Numeric atoms

    Each lone, action, and movement atom will be associated with a function of
    an appropriate type.

    Each numeric atom will be associated with its numeric value.

    When the parser determines that the input is incomplete, it should somehow cause
    this to be visually indicated. For example, it would be nice to add a light red
    tint to the background after an action atom has been entered which deletes text.

Use a block cursor in command mode. Accomplish this by two steps:

    1. Change the color of the normal cursor to match the background
    2. Change the foreground and background colors of the character after the cursor
       so it appears that the block cursor is there.
